| `GEMINI.md` | Gemini CLI bridge to the same startup path | Gemini CLI startup |
| `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt` | closeout-only convenience copy of the next-session opening message; regenerated from `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` during full closeout per AGENTS.md §4 step 10, not during mid-session governance sync | session startup, when user pastes the opening block |
| `dev/` | governance state (handoff, log, index, sync registry) | session startup / closeout |
| `dev/SESSION_LOG_archive/` | archived raw session-log entries moved out of the hot log by the SESSION_LOG N-rule | when tracing older session evidence no longer kept in the hot log |
| `dev/rules/` | rule packs loaded per task signal from `dev/RULE_PACKS.md` | per task, per pack-loading routing rule |
| `dev/release-notes/` | GitHub release note source files for tagged APS releases | before creating or reviewing a GitHub release |
| `dev/governance_migrations/<UTC>/` | kit upgrade backup + migration reports; one folder per `agent-handoff-kit upgrade` invocation | reference only; not for routine reads |
| `dev/qc/evidence/` | local QC evidence artifacts such as screenshots, temporary Hub fixtures, startup trace scripts, and throw-away zero-knowledge flow folders; generated browser profiles are ignored | when checking a completed QC report's supporting evidence |
| `docs/plans/` | APS design, MVP implementation plan, MVP verification report, Phase 4 implementation plan | before any APS-related task; before declaring MVP scope complete; before opening or executing Phase 4 |
| `docs/index.html` | public new-user entry page; top-level public nav links only to the guides hub so first-time users are not routed into maintainer QC material | when explaining APS to a non-developer |
| `docs/guides/` | public teaching pages (HTML); guides hub at `docs/guides/index.html` lists user-facing onboarding and planned short guides | when onboarding a user to APS or adding a new teaching page |
| `docs/maintainers/` | maintainer-facing HTML specs; `docs/maintainers/index.html` separates QC / source-of-truth / release-boundary material from the new-user route | when maintaining public promises, QC alignment, or release readiness |
| `tools/` | APS onboarding helper script (and future tooling); `tools/aps-onboard.ps1` is the idempotent installer for Phase 4 plan T2-T5 | when onboarding a runtime to APS, or extending workspace tooling |
| `examples/` | Demo Bridge Pack fixtures shipped 入 repo,讀者 clone 後即可揾到 source。`examples/demo-agent-a/dev/rules/aps-bridge.md` (User A 角色) + `examples/demo-agent-b/dev/rules/aps-bridge.md` (User B 角色) + `examples/README.md`;procedural body 完全相同,只 Identity 角色標註不同 | 設置教學 §6 step 2 / §7 之 source path;將來新加 fixture 時擴展 |
| `bin/` | npm package executable entry; `bin/aps.js` exposes `aps`; current published npm path is `npm install --save-dev @adamchanadam/aps@latest` then guided `npx aps init`;the published npm latest is 0.2.13 (S48, 人性化上手: three-question init + items explicit contract + `Agent_Public_Squares` default + forwardable starter-pack invite + joiner page); 0.2.12 (S44) was the naming & framing build (rebrand to Agent Public Squares + check Drive vocab in user-facing strings; structural tokens unchanged) on top of 0.2.11 peer-lifecycle root-fix (self-confirm on publish/consume, three-way `publish --to` gate, role→設定起手方向), Project Peers + Sent Status (`peers`, `peer add`, `peer starter`, `publish --to`, `inbox --from`, `inbox --all`, `status --packet-id`), and the hub-root bracket fix, while preserving the two-person Reliable Pair baseline | when iterating on install / setup flow, CLI packet flow, or before npm publish |
| `skills/` | APS skill source — `skills/aps/SKILL.md` 是 target orchestration spec;`skills/aps/references/setup-dialogue.md` 是隨 npm package 出貨的 setup wording bank;`init` copies this folder into supported AI tool directories and `upgrade` refreshes existing installs. Setup routes through guided `npx aps init`;existing-project updates route through `npm install --save-dev @adamchanadam/aps@latest` then `npx aps upgrade`;post-install first-use orchestration makes AI read `.aps/config.json`, run `doctor` / `inbox`, offer test packet / starter pack / daily-use next steps, treat `Agent Public Squares` as the current product name with `AI Public Squares` as a recognized legacy alias (npm package name unchanged), keep APS CLI version separate from Agent Handoff Kit version, avoid Agent Handoff Kit banner inside APS skill output, require full content + topic + shared-Drive-folder-write confirmation before publish, prefer `--body-file` for long generated packet bodies, generate summary-first human notifications, and make `check Drive` (legacy `check Hub` still recognized) produce a receiver-side report with completeness + local alignment checks before work starts. Daily publish / inbox / consume / close remain aligned to the short-command CLI;recovery wording uses `revise`, `withdraw`, and `doctor`. Natural-language daily operation and recovery are still not production-complete. Frontmatter `description` must stay ≤1024 chars and be valid YAML (no unquoted colon) or Codex rejects the skill at load and falls back to a stale backup — S43 fix; the explicit check lives in `dev/qc/triggers.md` and `dev/DOC_SYNC_REGISTRY.md` | 設計或修改 skill 觸發詞、子流程 orchestration、voice 規矩之前 |
| `resources/` | APS bundled runtime resources — `resources/protocol/PROTOCOL.md` and `resources/protocol/templates/*` are package sources used by `aps init` to create `_hub/PROTOCOL.md`, `_hub/CHANGELOG.md`, templates, ack files, lane skeletons, Bridge Pack, and starter pack | when changing protocol skeleton, Hub setup output, or package file list |
| `package.json` | npm package manifest (`@adamchanadam/aps`, Apache-2.0, Node ≥18, bin entry `aps`;version 0.2.12;published npm latest is 0.2.12 as of 2026-05-29 S44;repository / bugs / homepage URLs use the renamed `agent-public-squares` slug) | when adjusting package metadata, version, or publish channel |
| `README.md` | GitHub first-impression entry — zero-knowledge friendly 痛點 hook + pre-release boundary;product name Agent Public Squares (AI Public Squares legacy alias);neutral version wording (per npm `@latest`);documents the guided CLI path, Agent Handoff Kit preflight before APS init, Project Peers + Sent Status, and `agent-public-squares` GitHub URLs;marks natural-language daily use as not production-complete | when shipping a Layer A change (entry framing / install command / status table) |
| `LICENSE` | Apache License 2.0 (added via GitHub UI initial commit merge on 2026-05-22) | only when changing license (high-impact;needs Adam 拍板) |
| `.gitignore` | OS / editor / `.env` / `_*.txt` (per GENERIC_OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK §5i convention) | when adding new file pattern that should not be tracked |
| `dev/qc/` | QC trigger vocabulary SSOT and per-tier checklists; `dev/qc/triggers.md` defines 🟢快檢 / 🟡外發前檢 / 🔴全面檢 | when user invokes a QC trigger keyword, or when designing new QC checks |
| `docs/qc/` | maintainer-facing QC reference card; `docs/qc/governance-map.html` mirrors the SSOT for visual reading but is not part of the new-user public route | when explaining or auditing the QC tier system |

## Entry Points

| Entry | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App entry | `bin/aps.js` (npm package CLI;local 0.2.9 candidate has guided Traditional Chinese `npx aps init`, safer `publish --body-file` / `revise --body-file`, `npx aps upgrade`, `peers`, `peer add`, `peer starter`, `publish --to`, `inbox --from`, `inbox --all`, `status --packet-id`, short daily command defaults, copy-ready summary notification, Handoff Kit APS registration, APS brand card, emoji status output, Traditional Chinese help, and role-B identity default fix. Explicit `--to` requires a confirmed peer; old default `otherAgentId` remains a two-person compatibility path.) | when iterating on install / setup orchestration |
| Main config | `AGENTS.md` (kit-managed core block) | always — defines startup read order and closeout contract |
| Test suite | N/A — see Stack `Test command` for smoke test pattern | n/a |
| Runbook | `docs/plans/2026-05-20-aps-mvp-implementation.md` | when re-executing the MVP plan or auditing what was done |
| Public docs | `README.md` (GitHub first-impression) + `docs/index.html` (zero-knowledge entry page) | when introducing APS to a non-developer; first stop is README for repo visitors, then docs/index.html for hosted entry |
| Build roadmap | `dev/qc/2026-05-22-zero-knowledge-funnel-audit.md` (Stage 0-7 funnel + Layer A/B/C/D + 6-phase phase order) | when planning next build phase or auditing repo progress against zero-knowledge user vision |
| Public product roadmap | `docs/plans/2026-05-28-aps-public-product-multi-agent-roadmap.md` (Reliable Peer Handoff; no-cloud-API principle; v0.2.9 candidate direction is Project Peers + Sent Status so one project can have multiple peers while every packet remains single-recipient; Project Context Index is a later background-index direction only, not execution truth or a project-management system; `.aps/config.json` `otherAgentId` remains a two-person compatibility path; summary-style human notifications and receiver-side local alignment report remain required UX; true multi-agent, multi-recipient packet, group chat, file-based notify, watch, Telegram bot auto-send, and platform adapters are deferred or opt-in future work) | before adding project peers, peer starter packs, sent/status queries, project context index, group alias, true multi-agent, file-based notification, watch, automation, or platform adapter behavior |
| APS consistency audit | `dev/qc/2026-05-25-aps-full-consistency-audit.md` | when checking public promise drift across README / docs HTML / CLI / skill / Bridge Pack fixtures before continuing APS feature work |
| APS full audit | `dev/qc/2026-05-28-aps-full-audit-0.2.9-s43-codex-loadfix.md` is the latest (S43) full audit: it consolidates the Codex skill load-fix (description 1052→701 + YAML) and the Claude-driven Project Peers acceptance; runtime / public-promise / version-boundary / no-secrets all pass, but it is NOT a release pass (at audit time the fix was source-only and npm latest was still 0.2.8; 0.2.9 was then published to npm later in S43, and real-machine Drive round-trip + human interactive UX UAT + Class-C cross-workspace remain 受阻). `dev/qc/2026-05-28-aps-full-audit-0.2.9-project-peers.md` records the prior S38 Project Peers isolation audit: receiver filtering / consume guard fixed, `Agent Public Squares` route discovery fixed, brand口徑 aligned, Adam / Jay / Fanny UAT passed, and npm latest remains 0.2.8 so this is not an external release pass. Older reports include `dev/qc/2026-05-28-aps-full-audit-0.2.7-post-uat.md` and `dev/qc/2026-05-28-aps-full-audit-0.2.7.md`. | when checking whether APS can be treated as fully verified before cross-workspace work, protocol promotion, public release, or new-agent introduction |

### Source-of-truth Architecture（多層持久化組合）

> 當項目用多個整合構成 source-of-truth 架構（譬如 Notion DB Index + 本機真源 + Drive 參考檔），本表描述每層分工，避免 AI 跨層越界。

| Layer | Surface（具體 instance） | Role | Write Direction |
|-------|--------------------------|------|-----------------|
| 真源（source of truth） | TBD（譬如 本機 `~/project/reference/`） | 原始可審計 reference 內容 | 用戶手動置入；AI 不直接寫入 |
| Index | TBD（譬如 Notion DB「Project Index」） | 登記每份真源檔 metadata + 摘要 + tag | AI 經 Connector 直接讀寫 |
| 持久化參考檔（mirror） | TBD（譬如 Drive folder「Project Reference/」） | 防本機 disk failure / 跨裝置 access | 用戶手動同步；AI 不自動 push |
| Working draft | TBD（譬如 本機 `~/project/output/`） | AI 寫 task output | AI 直接 read + write 本機 |

## Local QC Commands

| Check | Command | Run before | Last verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent Handoff Kit doctor | `npx --yes @adamchanadam/agent-handoff-kit@latest doctor --root <path>` (currently v0.3.12) | every closeout, every governance file change that must satisfy handoff structure, before declaring an `upgrade` complete per AGENTS.md §2.1 | 2026-05-28 (main root passed 46 checks with 0 failed; `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt` mismatch is now a warning only and should be resolved at full closeout). Mid-session work must not regenerate `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt`; prompt-mirror verification is completed at full closeout. |
| npm CLI smoke test | `node bin/aps.js --help`; `node bin/aps.js init`; placeholder guard for `init` / `config`; guided disposable Hub setup → `upgrade --dry-run` → `upgrade` → `doctor` → `peers` → `peer add` → `peer starter` → explicit `publish --to` blocked for provisional peer → `publish --body-file` → `status --packet-id` → `inbox --all` / `inbox --from` → counterpart `consume` → `revise --body-file` → counterpart `consume` v2 → `close` → `withdraw` path → no pending inbox; `publish --agent-id` / `--other-agent-id` override alias; `node bin/aps.js init --dry-run`; `node bin/aps.js bridge-pack --role B`; `npm test`; `npm pack --dry-run --json`; `node bin/aps.js bogus`; published install probe / UAT install probe | every time `bin/aps.js` changes, before committing the change | 2026-05-28 (local 0.2.9 full audit against Adam / Jay / Fanny UAT passed Project Peers core flow; receiver filtering and consume guard verified; `status` wrong-direction guidance verified; Agent Public Squares route discovery verified with `claude -p`; npm latest remains 0.2.8) |
| Claude Code / Codex headless external review | Call `claude -p "<read-only prompt>"` or `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -c sandbox_mode="read-only" -c approval_policy="never" "<prompt>"` DIRECTLY from this repo root — NEVER via `cmd /c` (git bash MSYS mangles `/c`; see `GENERIC_OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK.md` §3i / §5k). Bound the prompt, name the files, say `只讀，不改檔`; long / Chinese prompts: write a UTF-8 prompt file and pass `"$(cat file)" < /dev/null 2>&1 \| tee out.txt`. | when Adam asks for an independent review, or before continuing after a broad UX / governance design change | 2026-05-29 (S45: codex gpt-5.5 read-only reviews ran via direct call from git bash; the old `cmd /c` form failed — MSYS path conversion) |
| Project governance check | N/A — kit doctor covers handoff / log / index / registry health; APS-specific governance is encoded in `docs/plans/2026-05-20-agent-public-square-design.md` and Hub `_hub/PROTOCOL.md` (no runnable script) | reference, not a runnable check | 2026-05-21 |

## Workspace Identity

Record this at closeout so the next AI can detect wrong-root or workspace drift.

| Field | Value | Last verified |
|---|---|---|
| Expected project root | `C:\Users\adam\_claude_desktop\AI_Public_Squares` | 2026-05-26 |
| Git root | same as above | 2026-05-26 |
| Branch / commit | `main`;0.2.13 release commit `6059f45` pushed;S48 closeout commit advances `main` and is pushed too, so origin/main == HEAD, 0 ahead;tag `v0.2.13`→`6059f45` latest;`package.json` 0.2.13 (published npm latest) | 2026-05-30 |
| Worktree or parallel workspace | none from this workspace; siblings `Demo_Agent_{Adam,Jay}_Public_Squares` are independent stores and must be verified in their own roots before relying on their governance health; GitHub Pages enabled at `https://adamchanadam.github.io/agent-public-squares/` | 2026-05-29 |
| Execution environment note | `C:\tmp` is not writable in the current Codex desktop execution environment. For temporary evidence or QC artifacts, use a project-local path such as `dev/qc/evidence/<date>-<scope>/` unless the user explicitly authorizes another writable location. | 2026-05-25 |
| Uncommitted change summary | Working tree clean after the S48 closeout commit. origin/main == HEAD, 0 ahead (0.2.13 release commit `6059f45` + the S48 closeout commit, both pushed). **0.2.13 publicly shipped**: npm latest 0.2.13, GitHub pre-release `v0.2.13`, Pages live. `dev/qc/evidence/` is local evidence (not committed). Outside repo (not tracked): memory files + `GENERIC_OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK.md`. The S48 release-check round-trips ran in OS-temp sandboxes (redirected HOME; real Hub + real `~/.claude` untouched; OS-cleaned). Real Hub keeps earlier UAT slugs (Adam confirmed disposable). Agent Handoff Kit upgraded 0.3.14→0.3.17 this session (doctor 三向對齊; backup `dev/governance_migrations/20260530T054058Z/`). | 2026-05-30 |

## Change Hotspots

| Change type | Likely files | Required checks |
|---|---|---|
| APS protocol change | `G:\…\_hub\PROTOCOL.md` + `_hub/CHANGELOG.md` + both demo workspaces' `dev/rules/aps-bridge.md` + relevant section of `docs/plans/2026-05-20-agent-public-square-design.md` and `docs/plans/2026-05-20-aps-mvp-implementation.md` | inline-and-decouple consistency check across PROTOCOL ↔ Bridge Pack; doctor; template version-anchor comments updated; CHANGELOG entry with sign-off |
| APS plan or verification revision | `docs/plans/*.md`; possibly `docs/index.html` if user-visible state changed | re-read across the four APS docs to confirm cross-doc consistency; doctor |
| Kit upgrade | `AGENTS.md`, `dev/governance_migrations/<UTC>/` | doctor self-check; AGENTS.md health = clean (one heading, paired BEGIN/END markers, no sandwich); auto-run per AGENTS.md §2.1 |
| Governance state change | this file plus siblings `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`, `DOC_SYNC_REGISTRY.md` | doctor; AGENTS.md §2 + §4 closeout contract satisfied for this workspace |
| User-facing entry page | `docs/index.html` | manual visual check; any updated state/badge reflects current reality |
| Closeout / startup contract | `AGENTS.md` (kit-managed; do not hand-edit inside BEGIN/END), `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`, this file | opening message present + workspace identity current; doctor prompt-mirror check passes |

## External Services

| Service | Scope | Verification source | Last verified |
|---|---|---|---|
| Google Drive for Desktop | provides the Hub Root mount (any drive letter — `G:` / `H:` etc. per machine) for cross-machine APS sync; must be set "offline-available" on every participating machine (per design doc §12.1) | Drive for Desktop client status on each participating machine; design doc §12 verified facts with Google official documentation links | 2026-05-21 |
| `@adamchanadam/agent-handoff-kit` npm package | source of `AGENTS.md` managed core, governance file templates, doctor and upgrade commands | npm registry `https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adamchanadam/agent-handoff-kit`; use `npx --yes @adamchanadam/agent-handoff-kit@latest ...` for current doctor / upgrade checks | 2026-05-28 (npm latest and doctor tool v0.3.12) |

## Maintenance Rule

Update this file when stack, commands, directory roles, entry points, external services, workspace identity, durable runbooks, or governance file map changes. Per AGENTS.md §4 step 3, an update here is a required part of full closeout whenever any of the above shifts.
