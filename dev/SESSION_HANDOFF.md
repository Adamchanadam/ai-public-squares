# Session Handoff

Last Updated: 2026-05-30 (S49 public-surface cleanup — Adam flagged GitHub repo right rail still showing `v0.1.1` as Latest and README exposing internal `.md` planning / audit documents. Authorized actions: commit, push, and change GitHub release. Local state updated so `README.md` no longer links `docs/plans/*.md` / `dev/qc/*.md` from the repo entry, `dev/release-notes/v0.2.13.github.md` removes the GitHub pre-release wording, and the current release boundary is `v0.2.13` as GitHub Latest release while product status remains early testing. S48 remains the underlying 0.2.13 release evidence: npm latest 0.2.13, release-check/full-check GREEN, Pages live, tag `v0.2.13`→`6059f45`, Agent Handoff Kit upgraded to 0.3.17, Project Context Index direction recorded.)

<!-- ack:section:durable-anchors -->
## Durable Anchors

Stable facts that should survive across sessions. Update only when they change, but verify they still match reality at closeout.

1. Project root and boundary: `C:\Users\adam\_claude_desktop\AI_Public_Squares` is the design / implementation / documentation SSOT workspace for Agent Public Squares (APS). It is not a product runtime workspace. The local working-folder name is still `AI_Public_Squares`; that rename AND the real Drive-hub folder rename are both DEFERRED to a separate no-live-session task (renaming a live folder mid-session breaks this session's cwd; renaming the shared Drive hub is an external + shared op). 0.2.13 (now PUBLISHED) changed only the DEFAULT shared-folder name for NEW installs to `Agent_Public_Squares` and scrubbed the underscore `AI_Public_Squares` from user-facing defaults / examples; existing `AI_Public_Squares` folders + configs keep working; the `AI Public Squares` product alias (with a space) is retained.
2. Product identity: Agent Public Squares is a cross-machine collaboration protocol and npm package (`@adamchanadam/aps`, Apache-2.0) for AI agents exchanging structured packets through a locally synced shared folder. `AI Public Squares` is a recognized LEGACY alias; `APS` is the abbreviation; the npm package name stays `@adamchanadam/aps`. **npm latest is `0.2.13` (early-testing public release, published 2026-05-30 S48).**
3. Governance model: Agent Handoff Kit doctor is the governance health check for this root. External skill flows, demo workspaces, and other tool outputs are subordinate evidence; this root's handoff / log / index / registry are authoritative for this workspace.
4. Runtime storage boundary: the shared Drive folder at `G:\我的雲端硬碟\Adam 工作目錄\AI_Projects\AI_Public_Squares\` owns runtime `_hub/`, templates, lane data, and ack files. This repo owns npm package source, public docs, plans, and QC truth. Structural tokens `hubRoot` / `--hub-root` / `_hub/` / `<hub_root>` / PROTOCOL schema / `setupHub` / `doctorHub` must NOT be renamed; only user-facing prose says 「共用 Drive 資料夾」.
5. Release boundary: GitHub repo `Adamchanadam/agent-public-squares` is public; Pages serves from `main` root. **GitHub release `v0.2.13` (tag `v0.2.13`→`6059f45`) is the Latest release**; older `v0.2.12`→`c9e8057` and `v0.2.8`→`136042c` retained as pre-releases. **npm `@adamchanadam/aps@latest` = `0.2.13`.** The receive trigger is `check Drive` (legacy `check Hub` still recognized as a hidden alias). Do not reuse the old repo name `ai-public-squares` (breaks GitHub redirects). Product remains early testing, not production-ready.
6. Product scope decision (locked 2026-05-29 S45): the automation / background-notification / scheduling layer — `aps watch`, file-based `_notify`, OS / AI-platform scheduling, desktop notifications, Telegram-bot auto-send / auto-pushing into a running session — is **OUT OF APS SCOPE**, NOT deferred. APS is a manual, human-in-loop, synced-folder structured-handoff protocol: it produces a copy-ready human notification and the receiver runs `check Drive` by hand. Deferred (still in-scope future): true multi-agent platform, multi-recipient packet, group alias, Project Context Index, Dropbox / OneDrive formal support.
7. QC discipline (locked 2026-05-29 S46): `bin/aps.js` is the user-visible-behaviour truth source; `skills/aps/**` and public docs are teaching layers that must follow it. Structure-level checks (`description` ≤1024 / valid YAML / trigger phrases / section + link integrity) passing does NOT mean the behaviour / product model is aligned — the two are not interchangeable. When CLI behaviour changes (question count, flags, generated artifacts, command contracts, exit codes), the teaching layers must be re-aligned, or the divergence recorded as a blocking gate in Risks + release gate. SSOT for this rule: `dev/qc/triggers.md` 外發前檢 9(d); memory `feedback-structure-vs-behaviour-drift`.

## Closeout-Reconciled State

This is the current-state area. At every full closeout, rewrite or explicitly confirm every section below. Do not append a new state snapshot under an old one.

<!-- ack:section:current-baseline -->
## Current Baseline

1. Workspace: `C:\Users\adam\_claude_desktop\AI_Public_Squares`, branch `main`, remote `origin = https://github.com/Adamchanadam/agent-public-squares.git`. The 0.2.13 release commit `6059f45` is pushed; `origin/main` == `6059f45` after that push. This S48 closeout commit advances `main` once more and is pushed too, leaving `origin/main` == HEAD, working tree clean, **0 ahead**.
2. Public release: **npm latest `@adamchanadam/aps@0.2.13`; GitHub release `v0.2.13` is Latest; GitHub Pages live with the 0.2.13 content.** `package.json` is `0.2.13`. All four public surfaces read back and agree (see Validation / QC).
3. **0.2.13「人性化上手」FULLY SHIPPED.** 第一段 (CLI) + 第二段 (skill) + 第三段+ (public surfaces + naming unification + starter-pack rewrite + joiner page) + B4/B5 + 第四段 UAT + **第五段 gated release** all DONE. Nothing about 0.2.13 remains.
4. **Naming unification (0.2.13, shipped):** new installs default the shared folder to `Agent_Public_Squares`; the underscore `AI_Public_Squares` is scrubbed from every user-facing default / example. The `AI Public Squares` product alias (space) + `check Hub` trigger stay recognized. Existing `AI_Public_Squares` folders / configs keep working. `docs/plans/*.md` keep the real-hub `…\AI_Public_Squares\` path as fact.
5. **Joiner page** `docs/guides/aps-join-invite.html` is live on Pages; `starterPackContent()` generates a forwardable invite linking to it (with the three install commands). `peer add` writes a project-scoped starter pack (`starter-pack-<project>-<peer>.md`).
6. Governance state: brand / vocab discipline holds. QC 9(d) behaviour-truth gate verified GREEN at the release-check. Agent Handoff Kit doctor `status: passed` (45 checks). **The Kit was upgraded `0.3.14 → 0.3.17` this session** (auto-doctor 三向對齊; AGENTS.md core skipped clean; only the handoff lifecycle placeholder + PROJECT_INDEX version record changed).

<!-- ack:section:task-understanding-summary -->
## Task Understanding Summary

<!-- ack:field:user-intent -->
- User intent: build APS into a usable public pre-release product for non-technical users, with reliable natural-language AI-assisted cross-machine handoff. Adam wants strong product / UX judgment, fact-checkable delivery, and root-cause governance — not patch-stacking. Each external action (publish / push / tag / release) is individually authorized.
<!-- ack:field:task-essence -->
- Task essence: **0.2.13「人性化上手」is now publicly shipped.** The whole staged build (CLI → skill → public surfaces + naming + starter pack + joiner page → UAT → gated release) is complete and verified across npm / repo / Pages / GitHub release. The active concern shifts to post-release follow-up (Kit tool upgrade, deferred renames, Project Context Index) and monitoring real-world 0.2.13 adoption.
<!-- ack:field:success-criteria -->
- Current success criteria (0.2.13): MET. npm latest is 0.2.13; the three-question / items / invite model ships across CLI + skill + public docs (9(d) GREEN); the shared-folder default is `Agent_Public_Squares` for new installs without breaking existing folders; automation stays out of scope; items is an explicit contract; every external action was individually authorized and read back.

<!-- ack:section:active-objective -->
## Active Objective

**0.2.13「人性化上手」is DONE and publicly shipped (S48).** No 0.2.13 work remains.

The **Agent Handoff Kit tool upgrade `0.3.14 → 0.3.17` is also DONE this session** (dry-run previewed → applied → auto-doctor `status: passed`, version 三向對齊 v0.3.17; AGENTS.md core skipped clean; only `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` lifecycle placeholder + `dev/PROJECT_INDEX.md` version record changed; backup `dev/governance_migrations/20260530T054058Z/`). No upgrade work remains.

Deferred (in-scope future, NOT this session): local dev-folder + real Drive-hub rename to `Agent_Public_Squares` (no-live-session / external-manual; a checklist can be produced when Adam is ready); Project Context Index design; true multi-agent platform; multi-recipient packet; group alias; Dropbox / OneDrive formal support.

Out of APS scope (NOT deferred): `aps watch`, file-based `_notify`, OS / AI-platform scheduling, desktop notifications, Telegram-bot auto-send.

<!-- ack:section:completed-this-session -->
## Completed This Session

Record only work actually completed in the current session (S48). Earlier S47/S46 work is in `dev/SESSION_LOG.md` and the archive.

1. **Ran 0.2.13 第五段 — gated release, end to end, with every external action individually authorized by Adam.**
2. **Version bump** `package.json` 0.2.12 → 0.2.13 (`bin/aps.js` reads version dynamically; `--help` / doctor / init confirmed v0.2.13).
3. **外發前檢 (release-check) + 全面檢 (full-check) GREEN.** Mechanical (node --check, npm pack 0.2.13/14 files, doctor 45, description 729 + valid YAML, bracket-path init regression), 9(d) behaviour-truth (teaching layers 0 old-model markers; the one `設定起手方向` hit is the CLI's own config display with a correct disclaimer), placeholder/PII/structural-token sweeps, HTML section balance + 0 local .md links + browser render (index/walkthrough 0 console error; join page only favicon-404), and a fresh isolated 0.2.13 protocol round-trip (init solo exit 0 / doctor solo exit 0 / publish-no-recipient exit 1 / peer add project-scoped starter / provisional hard-block / join / publish --to with items verbatim / inbox / revise preserve / --clear-items / consume). Report: `dev/qc/2026-05-30-aps-full-audit-0.2.13-release-check.md`.
4. **`npm publish --access public`** → `@adamchanadam/aps@0.2.13`; read back: registry version + dist-tags.latest 0.2.13, 14 files; `npx @latest --help` shows v0.2.13.
5. **`git push origin main`** (release commit `6059f45`, fast-forward `ff044e9..6059f45`); read back: origin/main == HEAD, 0 ahead.
6. **GitHub Pages** read back live (join page 200; index 「三條問題」present, 「五個值」gone).
7. **GitHub release `v0.2.13`** was originally created as a pre-release (`--target 6059f45`, body from `dev/release-notes/v0.2.13.github.md`) and then changed in S49 to the GitHub Latest release; tag remains synced to `6059f45`.
8. **S48 full closeout**: this handoff reconciled to the published reality; S48 log entry + N-rule (S38 → archive batch 009); PROJECT_INDEX workspace identity / release rows updated; PROJECT_DECISIONS evolution + insights appended; START regenerated; `v0.2.13.github.md` committed.
9. **Agent Handoff Kit tool upgrade `0.3.14 → 0.3.17`** (Adam's request): `upgrade --dry-run` previewed (create 0 / merge 1 = handoff lifecycle placeholder / skip 19 incl. AGENTS.md core clean / conflict 0), then applied; auto-doctor `status: passed` (45), version 三向對齊 v0.3.17; backup `dev/governance_migrations/20260530T054058Z/`. Re-reconciled this handoff + log + index to mark the upgrade done.
10. **Project Context Index — human-presentation direction recorded** (commit `ef729c3`): discussed with Adam and recorded in roadmap §4.5 the two-layer design (source `_context/*.md` markdown that AI reads/writes → CLI on-demand generated read-only HTML overview) + three guardrails (timestamped snapshot, packets-are-truth, traceable; on-demand, no auto-refresh; read-only, no kanban). Built a reference HTML mock with fake data in the `docs/` visual style (rendered, browser-verified) at `dev/qc/evidence/2026-05-30-context-index-mock/` (gitignored). Logged the architecture choice in PROJECT_DECISIONS. Implementation stays deferred until core validation.
11. **S49 public-surface cleanup:** README entry no longer exposes internal `.md` planning / QC files as a repo homepage route; release note source no longer calls `v0.2.13` a GitHub pre-release; GitHub `v0.2.13` is treated as the public Latest release while product wording remains early-testing.

<!-- ack:section:next-priorities -->
## Next Priorities

1. **Local dev-folder + real Drive-hub rename → `Agent_Public_Squares`** — deferred; both are no-live-session / external-manual tasks (do NOT do mid-session). A manual checklist can be produced when Adam is ready.
2. **Project Context Index design** — deferred (in-scope future). Direction recorded in roadmap §4.5 (S48): markdown source (`_context/*.md`, AI read/write) → CLI on-demand read-only HTML overview; the HTML stays a derived, timestamped, packets-are-truth, no-kanban snapshot in the `docs/` visual style. Reference mock (fake data, gitignored): `dev/qc/evidence/2026-05-30-context-index-mock/`. Implementation still deferred until core validation.
3. **Monitor 0.2.13 adoption** — Jay (and any new joiner) reinstall `@latest` (now 0.2.13) and exercise the three-question install + joiner page on a real machine; capture any defect.

<!-- ack:section:risks-blockers -->
## Risks / Blockers

1. **0.2.13 is published — no release work pending.** All four public surfaces (npm / repo main / Pages / GitHub release) read back and agree. Nothing about 0.2.13 is unpushed or unverified.
2. **Kit version drift RESOLVED**: the Agent Handoff Kit was upgraded `0.3.14 → 0.3.17` this session; doctor reports version 三向對齊 (tool / project record / npm latest all v0.3.17). No drift remains.
3. **`items` must use the explicit contract, never prose-parsing** (codex-validated, UAT + release-check confirmed): sender declares `--items`; CLI records verbatim into frontmatter; reader reads frontmatter only; `revise` preserves prior items unless `--items` / `--clear-items`.
4. **Naming / rename discipline.** New installs default to `Agent_Public_Squares`; existing `AI_Public_Squares` folders + configs keep working — do NOT force-migrate. Underscore `AI_Public_Squares` scrubbed from user-facing defaults only; `docs/plans/*.md` keep the real-hub path as fact; `AI Public Squares` (space) product alias + `check Hub` trigger stay recognized. The local dev-folder + Drive-hub rename are DEFERRED and must NOT be done mid-session (live-cwd / shared-folder hazards).
5. **Automation stays out of scope**: never re-add `watch` / `_notify` / OS+platform scheduling / desktop notifications / Telegram-bot auto-send.
6. **Brand / structural discipline**: never rename `hubRoot` / `--hub-root` / `_hub/` / PROTOCOL schema / `setupHub` / `doctorHub`; never reuse `ai-public-squares`. Any skill frontmatter edit re-measures `description` ≤1024 + valid YAML (currently 729).
7. **codex / claude-p invocation**: call directly (NOT `cmd /c`); long / Chinese prompts via a UTF-8 prompt file + `"$(cat file)" < /dev/null`. Runbook `GENERIC_OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK.md` §3i / §5k.
8. **Per-project Drive verification still required** for each real project (path, offline availability, sync).
9. **Real Hub / scratch**: the real Drive hub keeps earlier UAT slugs (Adam confirmed disposable UAT). The S48 release-check round-trip ran in OS-temp sandboxes with redirected HOME (real Hub + real `~/.claude` untouched); left for OS temp cleanup.
10. **QC discipline in force**: structure-pass ≠ behaviour-aligned; `bin/aps.js` is the behaviour truth; teaching layers follow; staged CLI-ahead-of-teaching must be tracked as a blocking item. SSOT `dev/qc/triggers.md` 外發前檢 9(d).

<!-- ack:section:validation-qc -->
## Validation / QC

- **0.2.13 release-check GREEN** (report `dev/qc/2026-05-30-aps-full-audit-0.2.13-release-check.md`): 外發前檢 (快檢 4 + 9 項) + 全面檢 可跑部分全部通過. Highlights — `node --check` clean; `npm pack --dry-run` version 0.2.13 / 14 files; skill `description` 729 ≤1024 + 0 colon-space (valid YAML); bracket-path `init --dry-run` exit 0 (0.2.10 regression holds); 9(d) teaching-layer old-model markers 0; HTML `<section>` balance (index 10/10, guides hub 3/3, walkthrough 16/16, join 7/7, maintainers 5/5) + 0 local .md links; browser render index/walkthrough 0 console error (join page only favicon-404, cosmetic); fresh isolated 0.2.13 round-trip all GREEN (incl. items verbatim, revise preserve = 2 / --clear-items = 0, consume ack written).
- **Post-publish read-backs (all agree):** `npm view` version + dist-tags.latest 0.2.13, 14 files; `npx --yes @adamchanadam/aps@latest --help` shows v0.2.13; GitHub Pages join page 200 + index 「三條問題」/ 0 「五個值」; `origin/main` == HEAD; `gh release view v0.2.13` reports `isPrerelease=false`, `isDraft=false`, target `6059f45`, Latest release; `git ls-remote --tags origin v0.2.13` → 6059f45.
- **Agent Handoff Kit doctor**: `status: passed`, 45 checks — both at the release-check (Kit v0.3.14) and after the **Kit upgrade to v0.3.17** (version now 三向對齊; prompt mirror + credential sweep ok).
- `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt` regenerated at this closeout.

## Workspace Identity

Expected project root: `C:\Users\adam\_claude_desktop\AI_Public_Squares`
Git root: same
Branch: `main`
Latest pushed state: the 0.2.13 release commit is `6059f45` (pushed; `ff044e9..6059f45`). This S49 public-surface cleanup commit advances `main` again and is pushed after README / governance cleanup. **npm latest `0.2.13`; tag `v0.2.13`→`6059f45`; GitHub release `v0.2.13` is Latest; Pages live with 0.2.13.** `package.json` is `0.2.13`.
Remote: `origin = https://github.com/Adamchanadam/agent-public-squares.git` (public, Apache-2.0, HTTPS via Windows Credential Manager). GitHub auto-redirects old web+git URLs but NOT Pages — do not reuse the old slug.
Worktree status: clean after the S48 closeout + Kit-upgrade commits. Agent Handoff Kit recorded version `0.3.17` (upgraded this session; doctor 三向對齊). Outside the repo (not git-tracked): memory files; `GENERIC_OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK.md`; OS-temp release-check sandboxes (auto-cleaned). Local working folder still named `AI_Public_Squares` (rename deferred).
Execution environment note: Claude Code on Windows, git-bash Bash tool + PowerShell tool. Isolated-hub tests use temp Hub + redirected HOME (real Hub + real `~/.claude` skills untouched); the redirect (HOME / USERPROFILE) and REPO/UAT paths must be re-exported in every Bash call. codex via direct call (never `cmd /c`).

📋 Next session: copy and paste the whole block below

```text
Work in C:\Users\adam\_claude_desktop\AI_Public_Squares (template SSOT for Agent Public Squares; npm `@adamchanadam/aps`; GitHub repo Adamchanadam/agent-public-squares is public; Pages enabled). Local working-folder name is still `AI_Public_Squares` (rename deferred).

Current state (2026-05-30, after S49 public-surface cleanup): 0.2.13「人性化上手」is PUBLICLY SHIPPED and fully read back. npm latest = `@adamchanadam/aps@0.2.13`; `package.json` = 0.2.13; GitHub release `v0.2.13`→`6059f45` is the GitHub Latest release (`isPrerelease=false`); GitHub Pages live with the 0.2.13 content; `origin/main` includes the S49 README / governance cleanup commit after S48. README no longer exposes internal `.md` planning / QC files as a repo homepage route. All four public surfaces (npm / repo main / Pages / GitHub release) were read back and agree. The 0.2.13 release-check report is `dev/qc/2026-05-30-aps-full-audit-0.2.13-release-check.md`.

0.2.13 shipped the「人性化上手」model end to end: three-question `init` (own side only; counterpart invited later via `peer add`), items as an explicit `--items` sender contract (verbatim into frontmatter; revise preserves / `--clear-items` empties), doctor local-core vs peer split (solo passes), publish actionable no-recipient guidance + reachability gate, the shared-folder default name unified to `Agent_Public_Squares` (underscore `AI_Public_Squares` scrubbed from user-facing defaults; existing folders keep working), a rewritten forwardable starter-pack invite linking to the new joiner page `docs/guides/aps-join-invite.html`, and project-scoped starter-pack filenames. CLI ↔ skill ↔ public docs are aligned (外發前檢 9(d) GREEN).

The Agent Handoff Kit tool was upgraded `0.3.14 → 0.3.17` in S48 (doctor 三向對齊 v0.3.17; AGENTS.md core skipped clean), so no Kit upgrade is pending.

The next actionable work is all deferred / monitoring: local dev-folder + real Drive-hub rename to `Agent_Public_Squares` (no-live-session / external-manual — do NOT do mid-session; a checklist can be produced when ready); Project Context Index design; monitoring real-world 0.2.13 adoption (Jay / new joiner reinstall @latest and exercise three-question install + joiner page). Out of APS scope (never re-add): watch / _notify / scheduling / desktop notif / bot auto-send.

Do not commit, push, tag, release, publish, or change GitHub Pages unless Adam explicitly asks (each external action is its own authorization). `items` uses the explicit contract, never prose-parsing. New installs default the shared folder to Agent_Public_Squares; existing AI_Public_Squares folders keep working; the underscore name is scrubbed from user-facing defaults only (`AI Public Squares` with a space and the `check Hub` trigger stay recognized); the local dev-folder + Drive-hub rename are DEFERRED and must NOT be done mid-session.

If this root does not match the expected project root, stop and ask for confirmation.

Voice / writing hard rule: user-facing prose must be contemporary written Traditional Chinese; no piled-up technical terms or clause numbers as sentence subjects, no broken Chinese-English fragments, minimal English. Colloquial Cantonese only inside verbatim user-trigger quotes. HTML must not link local `.md` files; use plain `<span class="path">` for internal spec paths.

Brand / vocab discipline: display name `Agent Public Squares`; trigger `check Drive`; concept 「共用 Drive 資料夾」; shared-folder default `Agent_Public_Squares`. `AI Public Squares` (space) and `check Hub` stay RECOGNIZED legacy aliases. Structural tokens `hubRoot` / `--hub-root` / `_hub/` / `<hub_root>` / PROTOCOL schema / `setupHub` / `doctorHub` must NOT be renamed. Do not reuse the old repo slug `ai-public-squares`. Any skill frontmatter edit re-measures `description` ≤1024 + valid YAML.

External review (read-only second opinion): call codex DIRECTLY, never via `cmd /c` (git bash MSYS mangles `/c`). Long/Chinese prompts: write a UTF-8 prompt file, then `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -c sandbox_mode="read-only" -c approval_policy="never" "$(cat promptfile)" < /dev/null 2>&1 | tee out.txt`. Method recorded in C:\Users\adam\_claude_desktop\GENERIC_OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK.md §3i / §5k.

QC vocabulary: if Adam says 跑快檢 / 跑外發前檢 / 跑全面檢 (quick-check / release-check / full-check), load dev/qc/triggers.md and run that tier; if vague, ask 「你指快檢 / 外發前檢 / 全面檢?」.

After reading, summarize current objective, confirmed decisions, pending work, risks, and the next recommended action.
