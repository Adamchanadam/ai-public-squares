# Session Log

Add new session entries at the top. Record what actually happened in the session; do not copy old completed work forward as new work.

This log carries recent evidence, not current state. Put the current objective, next action, risks, and workspace identity in `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.

Keep recent entries concise. If older entries no longer affect the next action, reduce them to short dated indexes that point to the durable source of truth. Archive long error output, validation detail, or research trails only when needed; do not create an archive directory by default.

Before closeout, check whether older log detail should be kept, summarized, or archived. Do not remove validation evidence, unresolved risks, or the latest opening message.

## 2026-05-29 (S45, latest) — Jay real-machine UAT GREEN; truncation fix; roadmap automation-layer prune; thinking-method memories + runbook codex method

- **ID:** S45
- **Summary:** Adam relayed Jay's real-machine APS feedback packet (Jay published from his Mac/Codex to the real Hub). Ran `check Drive` on Adam's side and received it — the cross-machine round-trip + the 0.2.12 `check Drive` trigger are now proven on a real second machine (prior #1 open item, substantially resolved). Triaged Jay's two defects: fixed one (truncation), deferred one (items) to a 0.2.13 explicit contract. Pruned the roadmap's automation layer to non-APS-scope. Wrote two thinking-method memories + a runbook codex-invocation entry. Full closeout. Nothing committed/pushed/published.
- **Jay UAT:** received `aps_uat_0_2_9_jay/from_jay/.../20260529T082314Z__aps_0210_uat_feedback v1` via Adam recv config at sibling `_aps_uat_adam_recv`; doctor's ❌ was only the scratch recv dir lacking Handoff Kit files (Hub side all ✅). Did NOT consume/reply (no Hub write). Jay confirmed receive flow + `check Drive` + 「教我用 APS」 work; flagged (a) inbox/notification summary truncation looks unfinished, (b) `items: []` not populated from body. Untested: Jay's 「Adam 收到未」 status step (non-blocking).
- **Fix (truncation):** `bin/aps.js` — added `clipWithEllipsis(value, maxLength)`; routed `packetScopeFromBody` (120) + `compactNoticeText` (220) through it (short unchanged, long → single 「…」). Verified in an isolated temp Hub (`mktemp`, real Hub untouched): long scope→「…」, short→none, >220 notice→「…」, jay inbox shows 「…」; `node --check` OK; two-agent init→publish→inbox no regression. Uncommitted, unpublished.
- **Defer (items):** chose explicit `--items` / `--items-file` contract for 0.2.13 over prose-parsing. Codex (gpt-5.5, read-only) confirmed prose-parsing AI-generated bodies is brittle (Jay's packet had no 「請對方做的事」 heading). Evidence `dev/qc/evidence/2026-05-29-codex-items-generality/`.
- **Roadmap prune:** removed the automation layer (watch / `_notify` / OS+AI-platform scheduling / desktop notif / Telegram-bot auto-send) and reframed as non-APS-scope (new §5; sections renumbered 一~十一; stages 6→4; success/compat/risk tables + deep-check list trimmed). Reframed `dev/qc/triggers.md` + `dev/DOC_SYNC_REGISTRY.md` 口徑 in the same unit. Codex review: 剪裁安全、無流程斷絕、無功能缺口; only requirement was the downstream 口徑 reframe (done). Evidence `dev/qc/evidence/2026-05-29-codex-roadmap-prune/`. `bin/aps.js` needs no code change for the prune.
- **Memories (in ~/.claude/.../memory/):** `feedback-no-hardcode-ai-content-parsing` + `feedback-no-cmd-c-codex-claude`.
- **Runbook (outside repo):** `GENERIC_OPERATIONAL_RUNBOOK.md` §3i (codex/claude-p invocation), §5k (cmd /c MSYS trap), §7 cheat row. codex reachable in git bash + PowerShell (codex-cli 0.134.0).
- **Changed (repo, all in one local S45 closeout commit, unpushed):** `bin/aps.js`, `docs/plans/2026-05-28-aps-public-product-multi-agent-roadmap.md`, `dev/qc/triggers.md`, `dev/DOC_SYNC_REGISTRY.md`; closeout: `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, this log, `dev/SESSION_LOG_archive/*`, `dev/PROJECT_INDEX.md`, `dev/PROJECT_DECISIONS.md`, `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt`.
- **QC:** truncation verified (isolated Hub + node --check); roadmap headings sequential, automation tokens only in §5/guardrails/history; doctor 45/45 passed; working tree clean after the S45 closeout commit; local 1 ahead of origin/main (`ff044e9`); no push.
- **Boundary:** One local S45 closeout commit (Adam authorized); NO push / tag / release / npm publish / Pages this session. 0.2.13 第一段 is the approved next step (deferred to S46 for clean focus).
- **Next:** build 0.2.13 第一段 (CLI four coupled + `--items`; truncation rides along); decide ship vehicle (0.2.13 vs 0.2.12.1) for the uncommitted fixes; maintainer-page vocab read-through in 第三段.
- **Log maintenance:** S45 prepended (hot log 11); N-rule archived the oldest entry (S35) into batch 009 → hot log back to 10.

## 2026-05-29 (S44) — published 0.2.11 + 0.2.12 (rename to Agent Public Squares); repo renamed + pushed; full-audit

- **ID:** S44
- **Summary:** Long session. (1) Published the S43-ready 0.2.11 peer-lifecycle root-fix to unblock Jay. (2) Adam flagged the onboarding walkthrough was still two-person + still said "Hub" — a doc-QC gap; added release-check item #9 (full-page content/product-model deep review) + widened the two-person-framing scan. (3) Codex (gpt-5.5, read-only) independently reviewed the 0.2.12 plan. (4) Built **0.2.12 「naming & framing」** via 7 parallel sub-agents + integration QC: rebrand AI Public Squares → Agent Public Squares (npm package name unchanged; old name kept as recognized legacy alias), check Hub → check Drive (check Hub kept as hidden alias), concept Hub → 共用 Drive 資料夾 (structural hubRoot/_hub/ kept), multi-peer walkthrough rewrite, version wording made neutral. (5) Renamed the GitHub repo `ai-public-squares` → `agent-public-squares` + synced 9 in-file URLs + git remote. (6) Ran 🔴 full-check (passed). (7) Published 0.2.12 + pushed `main`; all three surfaces (npm / repo / Pages) now show the new brand.
- **Changed:** `bin/aps.js`, `skills/aps/SKILL.md`, `skills/aps/references/setup-dialogue.md`, `README.md`, `docs/index.html`, `docs/guides/index.html`, `docs/guides/aps-onboarding-walkthrough.html`, `docs/maintainers/index.html`, `docs/qc/governance-map.html`, `resources/protocol/PROTOCOL.md`, `package.json` (0.2.12 + URLs), `dev/qc/triggers.md` (+item #9), `dev/DOC_SYNC_REGISTRY.md`, `dev/PROJECT_DECISIONS.md`, roadmap, `.gitignore`; new `dev/release-notes/v0.2.12.md` + `dev/qc/2026-05-29-aps-full-audit-0.2.12-naming.md`. Commits `9920e60` (0.2.12), `6089486` (setup-dialogue Hub fix), `3276ebd` (full-audit report); `127f55f` carried forward; all pushed to `main`.
- **Done (0.2.11):** preflight green, published `@adamchanadam/aps@0.2.11`, readback v0.2.11.
- **Done (0.2.12):** 7 sub-agents rewrote in fresh contexts; integration QC fixed a missed `bin/aps.js` route (added check Drive) + banner vocab, and a missed setup-dialogue.md "Hub" prose (caught by item #9 when Adam asked "全部對齊未"). Full-check: nested quick-check, 13-item release-check, isolated-Hub protocol roundtrip (no regression, new vocab consistent in runtime), 5-page browser render (0 console errors), spec-to-runtime 3-entry + brand split — all pass; only two-physical-machine real roundtrip remains blocked (post-publish UAT). Published 0.2.12; readback: registry version/latest 0.2.12, 14 files, `npx @latest --help` shows "Agent Public Squares" / 共用 Drive / v0.2.12.
- **Done (repo + push):** GitHub repo renamed to `Adamchanadam/agent-public-squares` (PUBLIC); `git remote set-url` updated; pushed `cde082b..3276ebd main->main`; local HEAD == origin/main == `3276ebd`. New Pages URL `adamchanadam.github.io/agent-public-squares/docs/index.html` returns 200 with brand "Agent Public Squares" + check Drive; old Pages URL 404 (expected). Handoff Kit doctor still `status: passed` after push.
- **QC:** 🟢 quick-check + 🟡 release-check + 🔴 full-check all green (full-audit report `dev/qc/2026-05-29-aps-full-audit-0.2.12-naming.md` committed). Post-publish readbacks done for npm + Pages + remote.
- **Done (GitHub release + tag):** cut tag `v0.2.12`→`c9e8057`, pushed it, and created GitHub pre-release `Agent Public Squares v0.2.12 - Pre-release` (isPrerelease=true, body from `dev/release-notes/v0.2.12.github.md`, cumulative 0.2.9–0.2.12). Readback: latest in the release list, tag synced to remote. Decision (Adam): 0.2.9–0.2.11 were npm-only with no per-version commit (source folded into `9920e60`), so only real-state 0.2.12 got a tag; the three intermediate versions live in release-notes files + the 0.2.12 release body. All three public surfaces (npm / Pages / GitHub release) now consistently show Agent Public Squares 0.2.12.
- **Boundary:** npm package name stays `@adamchanadam/aps`. Local working folder name `AI_Public_Squares` deliberately NOT renamed (deferred). 0.2.13 humanize-onboarding (3-question install etc.) deferred.
- **Pending:** (a) Jay reinstalls `@latest` (now 0.2.12) and retries his reply — end-to-end unblock + check Drive UAT still unproven on real Mac. (b) 0.2.13 humanize-onboarding. (c) local folder rename (own no-session task).
- **Risks:** Until Jay reinstalls + retries, the cross-machine unblock and check Drive trigger are unverified on a real second machine.
- **Log maintenance:** S44 expanded in place (hot log 11; N-rule archival of the oldest entry deferred to full closeout per AGENTS.md §4 step 11).

## 2026-05-28 (S43) — Codex skill load-fix + Claude Project Peers acceptance

- **ID:** S43
- **Summary:** Ran the deferred 0.2.9 UX acceptance. A headless `codex exec` probe found the published APS skill failed to load in Codex because the frontmatter `description` was 1052 chars, over Codex's 1024-char load cap, so Codex silently fell back to a stale 0.2.7 backup skill — a Codex-only release blocker. Fixed the repo skill source, then Claude drove a full Project Peers acceptance against the real Hub using a disposable test slug.
- **Changed:** This workspace only.
  - `skills/aps/SKILL.md` — frontmatter `description` trimmed 1052→701 chars, long trigger list moved to the body; an interim YAML error (unquoted colon in `Example triggers:`) was fixed to `Example triggers include`.
  - `dev/qc/triggers.md` — release-check and full-check now explicitly require `description` ≤1024 and valid YAML, noting Codex enforces this at load while Claude does not surface it.
  - `dev/DOC_SYNC_REGISTRY.md` — skill row strengthened with the same Codex ≤1024 / valid-YAML acceptance.
  - Governance: this entry plus `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` and `dev/PROJECT_INDEX.md`.
- **Done:** description 1052→701; frontmatter YAML fixed; refreshed `~/.codex/skills/aps/SKILL.md` and proved via `codex exec 教我用 APS` that the official 0.2.9 skill now loads with no invalid-description and no YAML error; deleted 11 stale `~/.codex/skills/aps.backup-*` (kept the live `aps`); Claude-driven Project Peers acceptance passed against real Hub test slug `aps_uat_claude_20260528` (peer add → provisional, provisional `publish --to` blocked, peer self-init → confirmed without downgrading the other card, `publish --to` confirmed peer succeeds, sender-only `status --packet-id` pending→consumed, receiver isolation so fanny never saw jay's packet, wrong-recipient consume rejected); 4 `codex_out*.txt` transcripts saved to `dev/qc/evidence/2026-05-28-codex-skill-loadfix/`; disposable scratch dir deleted.
- **QC:** `node --check bin/aps.js`, `git diff --check` (clean apart from repo-wide CRLF notices), description-length measure (701 ≤1024), and the Codex skill-load proof all passed; Handoff Kit doctor rerun as part of this sync.
- **Audit / release-prep (S43):** wrote the full-audit report `dev/qc/2026-05-28-aps-full-audit-0.2.9-s43-codex-loadfix.md` (runtime / public-promise / version-boundary / no-secrets pass; human UX UAT + two-physical-machine Drive + Class-C demo-workspace audit remain 受阻) and `dev/release-notes/v0.2.9.md`; mechanical release-check (doctor, git diff --check, node --check, npm pack --dry-run, bundled-tarball skill description 701, valid YAML, Codex skill load) all green before publish.
- **Boundary:** Later in S43, after the full audit and release-prep, Adam authorized npm publish of the 0.2.9 pre-release / UAT enablement build only. `@adamchanadam/aps@0.2.9` is now npm `latest` (readback: registry version/latest `0.2.9`, bin `aps`, fileCount 14; `npx --yes @adamchanadam/aps@latest --help` shows v0.2.9 + Project Peers commands). This is NOT a release pass — human interactive UX UAT, two-physical-machine Drive round-trip, and Class-C demo-workspace audit remain open. No commit / push / git tag / GitHub release was done; GitHub release stays `v0.2.8`, `main` is unchanged, and README / public HTML still say npm latest 0.2.8 pending an explicit public-framing decision. The governance sync did NOT touch the Hub; the earlier acceptance left test slug `aps_uat_claude_20260528` and overwrote `_hub/starter-pack-{adam,fanny,jay}.md`, left in place per Adam's instruction.
- **Real-machine UAT fix → 0.2.10:** Jay's Mac UAT hit a setup blocker — `aps init` rejected his legitimate Hub-root path `.../My Drive/[Project]/AI_Public_Squares` because the placeholder guard rejected square brackets `[ ]`. Fixed `validateNoPlaceholder` in `bin/aps.js` (now rejects only `<...>` angle brackets and `...` ellipsis; snake_case `--project` / `--agent-id` still bracket-checked by validateSnakeCase), bumped to 0.2.10, added a release-check regression guard in `dev/qc/triggers.md`, wrote `dev/release-notes/v0.2.10.md`, ran release-check, and — on Adam's authorization — published 0.2.10 to npm `latest`. npm latest is now `0.2.10`; the published build was verified via `init --dry-run` to accept the bracketed path, so Jay reinstalls `@latest` and uses his original path with no folder rename. Still no commit / push / git tag / GitHub release.
- **0.2.11 peer-lifecycle root-fix (local, unpublished):** Jay's Mac UAT then exposed the deeper bug — an active agent (already publish/consume) stuck at `provisional` blocks the other side from replying. Root-fixed in `bin/aps.js`: self-confirm on publish/consume, three-way `publish --to` gate (confirmed / provisional-but-active / blocked), and role→設定起手方向 reframe with a post-path auto-detect "joiner" hint. Bumped `package.json` 0.2.11, updated roadmap §4.2 + `dev/qc/triggers.md` + `dev/DOC_SYNC_REGISTRY.md`, wrote `dev/release-notes/v0.2.11.md`. Verified by `node --check`, `git diff --check`, and a controlled disposable-Hub regression. Two independent codex read-only reviews validated the design. NOT published — npm latest stays 0.2.10.
- **User docs rewrite:** rewrote `docs/index.html`, `docs/guides/index.html`, `docs/guides/aps-onboarding-walkthrough.html` to one-project-multiple-peers + 設定起手方向 + 前期測試版 in 公文 tone; removed jargon fragments + hard version numbers; 0 stale markers, 0 local `.md` links, balanced `<section>` tags. Hub→Drive vocabulary deferred to the onboarding change. Uncommitted; maintainer pages untouched.
- **Humanize-onboarding consensus:** agreed (Claude + 2 codex reviews) the next change — install asks only 3 (Drive folder / project / your name), counterpart optional, add peers on-demand, 「共用 Drive 資料夾」 vocabulary (keep 「check Hub」, promote 「check Drive」), role demoted, four coupled changes together (doctor / publish / two-person compat / starter-pack-timing). Recorded in handoff Active Objective + `dev/PROJECT_DECISIONS.md`; codex studies under `dev/qc/evidence/2026-05-28-codex-skill-loadfix/`.
- **S43 full closeout:** reconciled `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` and regenerated the Next Session Opening Message + `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt` from current state. Hot log stays 10 entries (S43 finalized in place; no new entry, no N-rule archival needed).
- **Log maintenance:** S33 moved to archive batch 009 by the N-rule; hot log stays 10 entries (S43 expanded in place at closeout).

## 2026-05-28 (S42) — closeout after v0.3.12 doctor verification

- **ID:** S42
- **Summary:** Adam said「收工」after release-check follow-up. Closeout reconciled the latest APS 0.2.9 candidate state, verified Agent Handoff Kit v0.3.12 doctor behavior, preserved `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt` as a closeout-generated convenience copy, and advanced SESSION_LOG N-rule archival.
- **Changed:** `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `dev/SESSION_LOG.md`, `dev/SESSION_LOG_archive/INDEX.md`, `dev/SESSION_LOG_archive/archive_009_2026-05-26_to_2026-05-28.md`, `dev/PROJECT_INDEX.md`, and `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt`.
- **QC:** Closeout reran Handoff Kit doctor v0.3.12, `git diff --check`, targeted stale-version scans, `npm view @adamchanadam/aps version dist-tags.latest --json`, and START prompt regeneration checks. HTML render evidence for the release-check lives under `dev/qc/evidence/2026-05-28-release-check-html/`.
- **Boundary:** No commit, push, tag, GitHub release, npm publish, or GitHub Pages deployment was performed. Local 0.2.9 candidate remains uncommitted and unpublished; npm latest remains 0.2.8.

## 2026-05-28 (S41) — Agent Handoff Kit v0.3.12 doctor verified

- **ID:** S41
- **Summary:** Adam upgraded / verified Agent Handoff Kit v0.3.12 behavior after APS release-check found the old doctor treated `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt` closeout-only drift as a failure.
- **Changed:** `dev/PROJECT_INDEX.md`, `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, and this log.
- **Verification:** `npx --yes @adamchanadam/agent-handoff-kit@latest doctor --root C:\Users\adam\_claude_desktop\AI_Public_Squares` reported v0.3.12, `status: passed`, 46 checks, 0 failed, and 1 prompt mirror warning. The warning says the convenience copy is behind and should be regenerated at full closeout.
- **Dry-run:** `npx --yes @adamchanadam/agent-handoff-kit@latest upgrade --dry-run` in this root reported create 0 / merge 0 / skip 20 / conflict 0, so no file upgrade was required. The remaining work was governance record alignment only.
- **Boundary:** `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt` remains unchanged mid-session. SESSION_LOG N-rule archive warning remains a closeout task.

## 2026-05-28 (S40) — closeout-only prompt rule restored

- **ID:** S40
- **Summary:** Adam corrected that `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt` is a closeout artifact, not a mid-session sync target. A follow-up audit then checked governance docs, README, public HTML, maintainer HTML, QC HTML, and index alignment against local 0.2.9 candidate / npm 0.2.8 published boundaries.
- **Changed:** `dev/DOC_SYNC_REGISTRY.md`, `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `dev/PROJECT_INDEX.md`, `docs/maintainers/index.html`, and this log.
- **Fix:** Durable sync wording now says `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt` is regenerated only at full closeout. The latest handoff now marks prompt mirror state as pending closeout instead of a mid-session sync. `PROJECT_INDEX` no longer carries the stale managed-core version phrase, and maintainer HTML now distinguishes published 0.2.8 Reliable Pair support from local 0.2.9 Project Peers candidate work.
- **Boundary:** `START_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.txt` remains unchanged in this step. Handoff Kit prompt-mirror doctor should be treated as a closeout check, not a mid-session requirement.

## 2026-05-28 (S39) — Project Peers full-audit scenario codified

- Short index: QC trigger truth now requires Project Peers one-by-one handoff isolation; durable details live in `dev/qc/triggers.md`, `docs/qc/governance-map.html`, and `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.

## 2026-05-28 (S38) — 0.2.9 full audit and receiver isolation fix

- Short index: local 0.2.9 Project Peers audit fixed receiver filtering / consume guard and Agent Public Squares route discovery; durable details live in `dev/qc/2026-05-28-aps-full-audit-0.2.9-project-peers.md` and `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.

## 2026-05-28 (S37) — 0.2.9 Project Peers UAT and starter pack fix

- Short index: Adam / Jay / Fanny UAT covered Project Peers and fixed new-peer Agent Handoff Kit preflight; durable details live in `dev/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`, `dev/PROJECT_INDEX.md`, and the latest full-audit report.

## 2026-05-28 (S36) — Project Context Index direction added

- Short index: Project Context Index was recorded as a later background-index direction only; durable details live in the roadmap, registry, index, and handoff.
